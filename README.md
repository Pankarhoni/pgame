## #  🎮 Mini 2D Platformer Game — Python + Pygame
Leap, run, and double-jump your way through floating boxes in this mini 2D platformer adventure!

This game was built using Python and Pygame, inspired by Vibe Coding tutorials, as a fun experiment into game mechanics like:
- Gravity
-   Collision detection
-   Sprite animations
-   Double jump physics
-   Directional movement and flipping
-   Platform interaction (like landing on boxes)

### 🧩 Features:
- 🕹️ Smooth left/right movement

- 🪂 Single & double jump logic

- 📦 Collidable box platforms

- 🎨 Animated pixel-art character using sprite sheets

- 🔁 Frame-based animation switching (run, jump, idle, fall)

- 📺 Runs at 60 FPS for a smooth experience

### ## 💻 Tech Stack:
- Language: Python 3.x

- Library: Pygame

- Assets: Sprite sheets from pixel art asset packs

- Editor: VS Code

### 🚧 Future Plans:🚧 Future Plans:
- Add enemies, scoring system, or a goal

- Include background music and sound effects

- Add more levels and a game menu

- Improve physics and sprite interaction

> PS: This game runs locally and was not deployed online. It uses local assets and is best tested on your desktop using Python and Pygame installed in your environment.
