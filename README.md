🎮 Mini 2D Platformer Game — Python + Pygame
Leap, run, and double-jump your way through floating boxes in this mini 2D platformer adventure!

This game was built using Python and Pygame, inspired by Vibe Coding tutorials, as a fun experiment into game mechanics like:

  Gravity
  
  Collision detection
  
  Sprite animations
  
  Double jump physics
  
  Directional movement and flipping
  
  Platform interaction (like landing on boxes)

🧩 Features:
🕹️ Smooth left/right movement

🪂 Single & double jump logic

📦 Collidable box platforms

🎨 Animated pixel-art character using sprite sheets

🔁 Frame-based animation switching (run, jump, idle, fall)

📺 Runs at 60 FPS for a smooth experience

💻 Tech Stack:
Language: Python 3.x

Library: Pygame

Assets: Sprite sheets from pixel art asset packs

Editor: VS Code

🚧 Future Plans:
Add enemies, scoring system, or a goal

Include background music and sound effects

Add more levels and a game menu

Improve physics and sprite interaction

PS: This game runs locally and was not deployed online. It uses local assets and is best tested on your desktop using Python and Pygame installed in your environment.
